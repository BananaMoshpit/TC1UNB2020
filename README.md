# TC1UNB2020
A three-part project from the Programming Techniques 1 class at Universidade de Bras√≠lia  
It'll become a mock investment system in wich users may create and invest in products after authentication,  
meant to introduce  
* documentation as code extraction through Doxygen,
* unit testing
* architecture and design patterns (specifically, layered modular architecture with domain driven design)
  
As it is, it only showcases the unit testing result for domains and entities and the presentation and authentication layers are yet to be implemented.
